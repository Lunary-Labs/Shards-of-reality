## Voidborn abominations

Eldritch entities born from the void, their forms shifting and morphing unpredictably. Voidspawn Abominations are nightmarish beings that defy the laws of reality. They can manifest terrifying and otherworldly powers, making them unpredictable and formidable opponents.

## Abyssal Phantoms

Ethereal specters with swirling tendrils of darkness, feeding on the fragmented fragments of shattered realities. Abyssal Phantoms draw strength from the chaos of the Void Apex, and their attacks can unravel the very fabric of existence, leaving their victims in a state of existential dread.

## Nihilus, the Eternity Devourer

Nihilus is an ancient being that has existed since the dawn of creation, forged from the chaos of the void itself. Nihilus wields unimaginable power and is capable of ripping apart the fabric of reality itself. Its malevolent presence is an existential threat to all realms, as it seeks to consume all of existence, leaving only an eternal void in its wake.

- Reality Sunder: Nihilus can tear through the barriers between dimensions, causing devastating rifts in the fabric of reality. These rifts release destructive energies that can annihilate anything in their path.

- Cosmic Annihilation: Nihilus can call upon the forces of the cosmos to rain down destruction upon its foes. Meteors, black holes, and other cosmic horrors manifest at its command, obliterating everything in their vicinity.

- Eternal Void Convergence: Nihilus's ultimate power allows it to merge with the void completely, becoming an unstoppable force of cosmic entropy. In this form, it is nearly invulnerable, and its power knows no bounds. Defeating Nihilus in this state is a near-impossible task.

Nihilus, the Eternity Devourer, represents the ultimate challenge for any who reach the Void Apex. Its insatiable hunger for the annihilation of all existence makes it a nightmarish and incomprehensible adversary, and confronting it is a battle on the very edge of reality itself.
