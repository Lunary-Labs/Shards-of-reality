# Main concept  

"Rogue-like" game like binding of isaac, procedural generation.  

# Ideas

- The game takes place in a very aggressive place, there are enemies almost everywhere. 
- The goal is to clear every levels without loosing sanity and to defeat all the bosses.   
- Taking items modify player stats and can change his attacks or add effects to his build.  
- in the 6th level, player can choose to combat every guardian he has not defeated (so 2 for each level)  
  They appear in waves of two, if the player is able to defeat them, he can choose a reward between 3 items.  
  Theses items are choosen in a pool of rarer items.
  

# Gameplay  

- At the start, player can only shoot __TO_FIND__.  
- At the end of a level, 3 items are proposed, the player can only choose one.  

## Resume

The character is an ancient god, that is now forgotten. He was banned and locked in a prison for eternity.  
This prison is called "Abyss", it's a dark place where all banned souls are sent.  
Being sent in the abyss is such a torment that anyone sent here become mad and aggressive.  

As a god, the character is still sane, but he need to protect his sanity at all cost.  
Being in contact with a soul corrupt him and damage his sanity.  

In order to escape the abyss, the character need to get some artifacts that are hidden in differents levels.  
Each artifact is protected by a guardian, killing them is the only way to get the artifact and reach the next level.
